## Description

The Medical Image Segmentation Tool Set (iSEG) is a fully integrated segmentation (including pre- and postprocessing) toolbox for the efficient, fast, and flexible generation of anatomical models from various types of imaging data. iSEG includes a variety of semi-automatic segmentation methods. The key strengths of iSEG are a) a powerful set of tools for manual segmentation (correction), b) support for massive image sizes, c) suport for segmenting complex models with a large number of tissues. iSEG features a plugin mechanism, which allows users to easily extend the application with custom widgets. The development of iSEG has been driven by the [Virtual Population](https://www.itis.ethz.ch/virtual-population/) project at the [IT'IS Foundation](https://www.itis.ethz.ch/), due to a lack of alternatives amongst open source and commercial tools.
