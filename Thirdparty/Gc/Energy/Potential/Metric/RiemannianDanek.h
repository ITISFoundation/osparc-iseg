                    This class implements calculation of edge weights approximating
                    a general Riemannian metric. 
                    
                    It is based on the following papers:
                    - O. Danek and P. Matula. <em>An Improved Riemannian %Metric Approximation 
                     for Graph Cuts</em>, In 16th IAPR International Conference on Discrete 
                     Geometry for Computer Imagery, 2011.
                    - O. Danek and P. Matula. <em>Graph Cuts and Approximation of the
                     Euclidean %Metric on Anisotropic Grids</em>, In VISAPP '10:
                     Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision
                     Theory and Applications. 2010.
                    - Y. Boykov and V. Kolmogorov. <em>Computing geodesics and minimal 
                     surfaces via graph cuts</em>. In ICCV '03: Proceedings of the Ninth 
                     IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, page 26, 2003.

                    Assume we have a regular orthogonal grid of nodes and that all these
                    nodes have equivalent neighbourhood \f$ \mathcal{N} = (n_1, n_2, \dots, n_N) \f$.
                    Further, assume we are given a metric tensor (symmetric positive definite 
                    matrix) \c D describing the Riemannian space in one given node and 
                    that \f$ T = \sqrt{D} \f$ is something what we call the <em>transformation 
                    matrix</em>. The weights approximating the Riemannian space in given
                    node are calculated as follows:

                    \f[
                        w_i = \frac{\Delta \rho_i \Delta \phi^v_i}{k}
                    \f]

                    where k is \f$ 2 \f$ or \f$ \pi \f$ for \c N=2 and \c N=3, respectively,
                    \f$ \Delta \phi^v_i \f$ is partitioning of the space of all angular orientations
                    among vectors in \f$ \mathcal{N} \f$ and \f$ \Delta \rho_i \f$ is the density 
                    of lines generated by vector \f$ n_i \f$ in the Riemannian space.
                    
                    To calculate \f$ \Delta \rho_i \f$ one can use the following formula: 

                    \f[
                        \Delta \rho_i = \frac{\mathrm{det} \, T}{|T \cdot n_i|}
                    \f]

                    To calculate \f$ \Delta \phi^v_i \f$ we use the following approach.
                    Let \f$ \mathcal{S} = (\frac{T \cdot n_1}{|T \cdot n_1|}, \dots, 
                    \frac{T \cdot n_N}{|T \cdot n_N|}) \f$ be
                    a set of points of a hypersphere representing the space of all
                    possible angular orientations. We calculate the Voronoi diagram of 
                    these points on the \f$ N-1 \f$ hypersphere surface manifold and
                    set \f$ \Delta \phi^v_i \f$ to be the area/length of the Voronoi cell
                    corresponding to point \f$ \frac{T \cdot n_i}{|T \cdot n_i|} \f$.

                    The difference between this approach and the one used in RiemannianBoykov
                    is that this approach gives better approximation with smaller error
                    but is more complicated to calculate (slower). Comparison can
                    be found in the referenced papers.

                    isotropic/anisotropic node spacing resolution see SetTransformationMatrix().
